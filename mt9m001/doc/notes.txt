To check pinmux configuration:
export PINS=/sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux/pins
cat $PINS

I was not able to make the hdmi and emmc pins work as outputs. Assuming they
all work as inputs (only a few have been tested) this can be solved by some
reshuffling. Specifically, SYSCLK needs to move from pin 28 to 12 (on p8), and
a physical jumper is needed from pin 12 to pin 28. P9 pin 25 and p8 pin 28 must
then also be configured as inputs. EXPOSURE, BUF_ENABLE, and DATAREAD are not
essential and can be dispensed with. This change is now reflected in
pinmux_config.sh and the pin assignments in pru firmware.

I can't think of any straightforward way of testing pru firware short of
plugging in the board.  Thus my next steps are to write tentative PRU driver
that reads in a single frame, assemble the board, write software to configure
the sensor via i2c, plug in the sensor, put it in single-trigger mode, and
finally then try to take and record an exposure. 

TODO:
Make the system more fault tolerant. this includes allowing pru1 to send pru0 a
signal for completion in case te number of pixels read is not consistent from
readout to readout

Discovered that the reason I couldn't output to p8_30 and all those pins was that
they belong to pru1. The test program was running on pru 0. Pinmuxing has been 
re-changed, sysclk is p8_28 once again

For "hello world" from the sensor do the following: 
i2cdetect -y -r 1
To dump all register values:
i2cdump -y 1 0x5d w
Confirmed working with clock frequencies up to 33 MHz (6 PRU clock cycles per
SYSCLK cycle)

resolved problems with i2c comm (including full crashes of the i2c interface on
the sensor) by putting in 10k pullup resistors (even though it is clamed the
BBB has pullups configured by default). Improved i2c interface code, now an

TODOs:
-separate pru code to just provide a clock before the readout firmware is loaded

array of address value pairs can be written all at once to the device.
