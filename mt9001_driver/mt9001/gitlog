    removed diagnoal-wise corection and reinstated proper dark frame subtraction, with a 1 pixel shift in the dark frame that resolves the previous issue

    number of frames is now passed as a parameter from host to local ddr of both prus. only perfunctory check has been done to see that everything still works.

    implemented subtraction of row-by-row variation and of the checkerboard background pattern. The former addition has a big runtime penalty, so I need to think about whether it's really necessary. The dark frame subtraction is now only a subtraction of the average level, rather than a pixel-by pixel subtraction, since the structure in the dark frame is pretty much wholly described by this checkerboard pattern. If row variation correction can really be dispensed with, this opens the possibility of doing on-the-fly accumulation of the histogram on the pru, which would allow a big increase in framerate

    returned to taking batches of 4 frames, with flushing before each batch so that the frames are all of the same intensity

    now generates a row-by-row histogram of isolated event values with a view towards using this sensor for x-ray spectroscopy in a point-to-line focusing geometry

    added handling of command-line parameters for threshold level, dark frame subtraction file, and output file name prefix. perfunctory testing suggests dark frame subtraction works, need to do more testing

    reduced batch sze to 1 and eliminated flushing, to get rid of dead time without making the first frame in each batch overexposed compared to the others

    we now transfer data from the pru/arm shared buffer four frames at a time. known issues: this causes the first frame in each batch of four to be overexposed, due to the camera's idle time while the arm is copy four previous frames
